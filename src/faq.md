title: Hi! Here are some questions nobody's asked but might?
---
My name is Ginny Mae, and you can call me Ginny or Ginny Mae! I'm a stereotypical girl who likes: programming, video games, and lots of other nerdy things!

## What should I call you, you seem to have too many names now

okay. yeah. that's fair. in most places i use ginny, ginny mae, or some ginny-based derivative. At work I go by my middle name, Mae.

Legally changing my name is in progress, but takes months. So I still have to use my legacy name in situations where that matters,
like my Costco membership card.

## Are there any negatives to being transgender?

Not inherently! Some do come along with living in a transphobic society though!

Transitioning itself is hard, slow, and *very expensive*.

## Are you a boy or a girl? What is your gender?

I'm a girl, and always have been.

## Are You Sure? What if you are wrong or change your mind?

Am I sure? Yes.

## What does {person} think?

I don’t know or care that much, you should ask them instead of me. Maybe y’all can keep a spreadsheet.

## Where did your name come from? {#my-cute-name}

*Ginny* came from a book series I loved reading when I was in my 20s. Ginny is the youngest daughter in a large family. She starts shy and somewhat frequently in need of saving, but grows into a powerful and
fierce woman. I considered other names, but Ginny stuck. (As a side note, there was a high chance it’d have been Luna if a bunch of cis friends hadn’t named their stupid babies Luna and who
even knows what gender those babies really are. {Come to think of it, Luna would have made my initials LMR which is basically “lamer” so..... babies forgiven?})

*Mae* (short for Maeve or Medb) is a queen from Irish mythology, described as “so beautiful that [she] robbed men of two-thirds of their valor upon seeing her”. Medb insisted on being
equal in wealth with her partners, and when she realized she was short one very good bull she started a war. A lot of people died! She is goals.

I like the flow of the two names together as well as each name individually. I also like that they have different vibes. Ginny feels diminutive, soft, cute,
and feminine. Mae is a single syllable and feels a bit more mature.

Also, importantly: the domains and usernames were available.

## Am I, the asker and current reader of this question, trans?

I'm happy to talk about experiences with gender and gender dysphoria. I can send you [tons of resources](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/am-i-trans) - more than you could possibly want.

But I can't tell you if you are transgender. Heck, even if I *did*... would you believe me?

## Why does your website look like this???

web design is my passion

The current site design, unless I do a redesign and forget to update this question, is a copy of the first proper website I launched back in 1997. I grabbed the
source from the Wayback Machine, did a few very small tweaks, and then turned it into an [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) template.

(Throwbacks like 90's designs and 88x31 buttons are considered retro cool, so I am both a trend setter and a trend follower.)

Alternatively and more simply stated: i think it's funny but ymmv
